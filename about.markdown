With extensive expertise in signal and image processing, I have built imaging systems from scratch, written the software for these systems, and supported customer use. My experience ranges from startups, small companies to a university lab to a large medical device company; as such I am able to collaborate and communicate with coworkers from different disciplines and customers from around the world. I am interested in new projects from which I can learn, in particular those pertaining to image processing in a novel field with scientific applications.
